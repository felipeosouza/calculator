# Calculator
Calculator project from Udemy course.

# Observation
In this project I learned that useState isn't fast enough to handle quick subsequent changes, especially when there's nesting, so touches weren't fully recognized, which made me use useReducer to make it smoother.
# Scrollable Display
The display is a ScrollView that scrolls to the end everytime the content changes to help with the typing.
